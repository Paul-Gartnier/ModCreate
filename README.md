## **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run ModCreate locally:


   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ModCreate.git
   touch .env

   ```
   ```bash
   cd ModCreate
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   import os

   load_dotenv()
   secret_key = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", "default_secret_key")

   ```

   ```bash
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
   filename='logs/app.log',
   level=logging.DEBUG,
   format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
   )
   logging.info("ModCreate application started.")
```

Run Pre Launch Checks
   ```bash

import os

def check_environment():
    required_env_vars = ["SECRET_KEY"]
    for var in required_env_vars:
        if os.getenv(var) is None:
            print(f"Error: Environment variable {var} is not set.")
            return False
    return True

def check_dependencies():
    try:
        import flask
        import transformers
        print("Dependencies verified.")
        return True
    except ImportError as e:
        print(f"Missing dependency: {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if check_environment() and check_dependencies():
        print("Pre-launch checks passed.")
    else:
        print("Pre-launch checks failed. Please fix the issues above.")

Run the script
   ```bash
python pre_launch_check.py
```
